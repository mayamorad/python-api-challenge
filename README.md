The WeatherPy directory includes two Jupyter Notebook source files—WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb—that retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify APIs for over 500 cities within the specified coordinates. Additionally, there’s an output_data repository that holds the images generated by WeatherPy.ipynb.

Both notebooks use the Pandas library to construct DataFrames for their datasets. Matplotlib is utilized to produce a series of scatter plots based on various variables, while Scipy and its linregress function assist with statistical computations and the creation of linear regression lines. Furthermore, Citipy generates lists of cities based on coordinates, hvplot facilitates interactive data visualizations, and geoviews enables geographical exploration and visualization of the data.
